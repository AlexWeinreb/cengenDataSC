Title: C elegans Single-Cell Thresholded Expression
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alexis Weinreb
Maintainer: Alexis Weinreb <alexis.weinreb@yale.edu>
Description: The CeNGEN consortium used single-cell RNA-Seq to establish a profile
    of every neuron in the nemaode C. elegans. The raw dataset was thresholded at several
    confidence levels to predict expression of each gene in each neuron. This package
    supplies both the thresholded matrices and expression metrics.
